main.css is garbage. don't know how to remove it yet

to get this to work, install better discord and install any theme and replace the css in it with allCSS.css

additionally, i have a modified version of the "Dark Matter" theme running simultaneously.


// modified dark matter start

@import url('https://DiscordStyles.github.io/DarkMatter/src/base.css');

/* Variables */
:root {
    --avatar-size: 30px;
    --accent: 37, 172, 232;
    --accent-alt: 29, 101, 134;
}

// modified dark matter end

you may have to toggle the two themes on and off in different sequences to get the desired effect
i'll upload a pic at some point. for now i don't want to spoil the fun.
